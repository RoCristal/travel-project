        <h2>Why Buenos Aires?</h2>
        <h3>Buenos Aires, the city of seven hills</h3>
        <p>
          The legend has it that Lisbon was named Olissipo by the Romans,
          for its resemblance to the Roman capital. Just like Rome, Lisbon
          began its life as a humble settlement nestled among seven hills.
          However, it wasn't until the 17th century, in the writing of Frey
          Nicolao d'Oliveira, that Lisbon came to be called 'a cidade das
          sete colinas' - the city of seven hills.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can still see traces of ancient Lisbon today. Beyond the array
          of shops with international brands, peaceful streetside cafes
          selling the iconic pastel de nata and world class restaurants with
          a variety of global cuisine, you can still wander the seven hills
          and see the city from above, taking in the rolling terracotta
          rooftops, the whitewashed walls and on the horizon, the soft blue
          sea.
