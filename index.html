        <h2>Why Buenos Aires?</h2>
        <h3>Buenos Aires, the city of seven hills</h3>
        <p>
          TThe Autonomous City of Buenos Aires is the capital of the Argentine Republic. It is located in the central eastern region of the country, on the western bank of the Río de la Plata estuary, in the pampas plains. It has an estimated population of almost 3 million, with 12 million in its urban conglomerate, known as Gran Buenos Aires, which makes it the country’s largest urban area, the second in South America and the southern hemisphere, and one of the twenty biggest cities in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The City of Buenos Aires has strategic importance, both nationally and regionally. It is the main financial, production and educational center in the country and it is the heart of Argentina’s cultural and intellectual activity. Its most distinctive features are: its theaters (the city has the largest number of theaters in the world); its music, with tango, and its traditional gastronomy, in which asado and mate stand out.
        </p>
        <p>The City, like the whole country, has a public system of hospitals and educational centers. In addition, it has a public
        transport network of buses, subway lines and interurban railways, as well as an airport and a harbour.</p>
